# first-website-database-webserver
Teaching myself how to build a website with a database and have it run on a webserver using a public IP for access

## What is the purpose of this repository?
This is just a repo to document myself learning the basics of web development.

## What should the final product look like?
I'm hoping to have a basic webserver set up that someone can actually create an account on. I can then save their account to a database, and then when they log back in there will be a SQL query to compare their credentials and allow them to login.

## Will there be a purpose to this website?
Currently it's just for learning, although if I get skilled enough then why not make a social media. I don't really think I have the patience for that however.
